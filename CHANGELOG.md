# Changelog

## 2.1.0

Updated WeFitterLib to v3.1.0

Heart rate samples, daily detail and daily summaries are stored much faster. Before, a long history (for example a start date of 3 months ago) took longer to process than iOS allows in the background, so heart rate samples uploaded only a few days at a time and fell behind

Uploads are sent in chunks of up to 7 days of 15 minute samples, and each chunk is marked as uploaded when it succeeds

Fixed data being uploaded again when it was stored while an upload was running

Fixed heart rate samples, daily detail or daily summaries not syncing until the app restarted after a query returned an error or no results

Added a privacy manifest to WeFitterLib

## 2.0.2

Fixed crash when trying to read `cyclingCadence`

## 2.0.1

Fixed missing heart rate and steps in workout

Added streaming data to workouts

## 2.0.0

Improved check that determines if there is new data that should be uploaded

Prevent fetch queries for the same datatype to run multiple times at the same time

Replace upload query in the queue when a new upload query is available

Changed default start date from 20 to 7 days back to improve performance

Added `enableDailyDetail` and `enableHeartRateSamples` to `config`. These datatypes contain a lot of data. Especially if too much historic data is requested. This results in queries that run for a long time and can slow down syncing of data. Daily summaries are not affected by this setting.
